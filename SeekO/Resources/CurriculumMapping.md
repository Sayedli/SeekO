# Curriculum Mapping

## Kindergarten

### Shape Garden (Geometry)
- **Skill focus:** Recognizing and naming two-dimensional shapes within real-world contexts.
- **Standards Alignment:**
  - **CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.K.G.A.2:** Students correctly name shapes regardless of their orientations or sizes.
  - **CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.K.G.A.4:** Students analyze and compare two-dimensional shapes, describing similarities, differences, parts, and other attributes.
- **In-game evidence:** Learners hear a prompt (e.g., “Find the triangle”) and select the matching shape from a set of varied options, reinforcing listening and visual discrimination.
- **Extension ideas:** Invite learners to explain how they identified the shape or to search for the same shape in their environment after play.
