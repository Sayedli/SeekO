# Curriculum Mapping

## Kindergarten

### Shape Garden (Geometry)
- **Skill focus:** Recognizing and naming two-dimensional shapes within real-world contexts.
- **Standards Alignment:**
  - **CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.K.G.A.2:** Students correctly name shapes regardless of their orientations or sizes.
  - **CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.K.G.A.4:** Students analyze and compare two-dimensional shapes, describing similarities, differences, parts, and other attributes.
- **In-game evidence:** Learners hear a prompt (e.g., “Find the triangle”) and select the matching shape from a set of varied options, reinforcing listening and visual discrimination.
- **Extension ideas:** Invite learners to explain how they identified the shape or to search for the same shape in their environment after play.

### Letter Garden (Phonics)
- **Skill focus:** Associating letter names and sounds with uppercase and lowercase letter forms.
- **Standards Alignment:**
  - **CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RF.K.1.D:** Recognize and name all upper- and lowercase letters of the alphabet.
  - **CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RF.K.3.A:** Demonstrate knowledge of one-to-one letter-sound correspondences by producing the primary sound for each consonant.
- **In-game evidence:** Students listen for the featured letter sound, scan the garden for its matching letter tile, and receive corrective feedback that reinforces both the letter name and phoneme.
- **Extension ideas:** Have learners practice air-tracing the letter or finding classroom objects that begin with the same sound.

### Counting Carnival (Numbers & Cardinality)
- **Skill focus:** Counting objects with one-to-one correspondence and understanding cardinality.
- **Standards Alignment:**
  - **CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.K.CC.A.1:** Count to 100 by ones and tens.
  - **CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.K.CC.B.4:** Understand the relationship between numbers and quantities; connect counting to cardinality.
- **In-game evidence:** Learners count a set of carnival items, tap each item as they count aloud, and confirm the total, reinforcing stable order and cardinality.
- **Extension ideas:** Transition to tangible counters (e.g., manipulatives or classroom objects) and compare which sets have more, fewer, or equal items.

### Pattern Parade (Patterns & Algebraic Thinking)
- **Skill focus:** Identifying, extending, and creating repeating patterns (AB, ABB, ABC).
- **Standards Alignment:**
  - **CCSS.MATH.PRACTICE.MP7:** Look for and make use of structure while reasoning about repeating units.
  - **NAEYC Early Math Standards:** Recognize, copy, extend, and create simple repeating patterns.
- **In-game evidence:** Learners inspect a partially completed parade float pattern, choose the correct next element, and receive prompts to describe the repeating unit.
- **Extension ideas:** Encourage learners to build their own physical patterns with classroom manipulatives or movement (clap-hop-clap) and describe the pattern unit aloud.
